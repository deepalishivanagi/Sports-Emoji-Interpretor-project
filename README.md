# Sports-Emoji-Interpretor-project
Created with CodeSandbox
 
 Link to have a look on my created first ReactJs project:https://yh1ojn.csb.app/

1.I have created this project using Reactjs.

2.Created two different child components called input & like ,then composed these in parent App.js component.

3.In this project I have used input element which will take user input & check the meaning from object I have created.

4.The entered emoji's meaning will be shown below. 

5.Created object with emoji's as key & meaning as values.

6.After clicking on emoji list below will also show the meaning of it.

6.To show meaning I have converted object to array & applied map function on it.

7.Created like component consisting of button which on clicking will count the number of likes clicked.

8.Here I have used clickHandler function to increament the count.
